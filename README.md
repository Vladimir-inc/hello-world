# hello-world
This is my first repository. So i don't know what is it, but this is interesting :-) 

So this is funny, I would never thought that I would get interested in programming and start doing something. 
My goal is to change the economy and improve it by getting and processing more data. So my path will be difficult and exciting
:-)
